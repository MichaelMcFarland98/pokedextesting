# Overview

This is a JavaScript project I decided to work on to increase my knowledge of JavaScript and working with API's. Plus who
doesn't like reminiscing of their childhood and building their very own Pokedex!?! 

To start the web app, you will type 
### ``` npm start ```

# Development Environment

Like mentioned earlier, I used JavaScript to react this project. I also used React to build the web app. A huge resource was the website and documentation for the Poke API!

# Useful Websites

* [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Poke API](https://pokeapi.co/?ref=public-apis)

# Future Work

* Adding in Regions 
* Adding moves and strengths of pokemon
* Being able to compare two pokemon
